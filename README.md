# zx-sprinter-sdk

This is SDK for Sprinder ZX-Spectrum (Nedo PC). Code is based on Sprinter port of Evo version of the game Uwol: Quest For Money.
In the Spriter port lots of tools from evo SDK were adopted. Therefore philosophy behind Evo SDK was preserved and
continued in a form of user friendly toolset.

SDK shares philosophy out of the box ready, so everything inside the repository. Checking of examples is a good starting for
development of your games for Sprinter.

Important: before use sdk you need to execute compile.bat in sdk folder for registering path to sdk
in enviroment variable. This will make possible to use SDK from any location on a computer
